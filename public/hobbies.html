    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

    <h2>Martial Arts</h2>
    I am a huge martial arts fan! Living in Tokyo I love watching old PRIDE
    fights and very much love watching UFC fights. I currently study Kyokushin
    Karate and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu

    <h2>Chess</h2>
    I'm currently learning how to play chess but I'm just a beginner.

    <h2>Piano</h2>
    Scott Joplin and Charles Debussy are my favorite pieces. I'm learning to
    play them now and I'm having fun making mistakes.

    <h2>Old School Games</h2>
    Megaman, anyone?
